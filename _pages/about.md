# üéä Welcome to my website!

I am currently a Ph.D. student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at Rutgers University under the supervison of [Prof. Jingang Yi](http://coewww.rutgers.edu/~jgyi/). I am a detail oriented PhD student interested in human robot interaction, ‚Äãlegged robots, machine learning and control. I love to collaborate and work with different people on multi-disciplinary projects. And from extensive course work, I have built up a solid background in mathematics and dynamic modeling. ‚Äã

Previously during my master‚Äôs study at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), I worked on the hexapod design and control project in the CRAB lab supervised by [Prof. Kathryn Daltorio](https://engineering.case.edu/research/labs/Daltorio/), and the joint hexapods locomotion project with National University of Singapore(NUS) supervised by Prof. [Guillaume Sartoretti](https://www.marmotlab.org). 

I received my Bachelor‚Äôs degree from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), China in 2019 with my major in Mechanical Engineering. During this period, I worked on quadruped robot design and control in CLEAR Lab with [Prof. Wei Zhang](https://www.wzhanglab.site).

Please find my [CV](./docs/CV.pdf) here for more about my research projects and background. And please feel free to contact me for any questions or opportunities. 


<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision.
